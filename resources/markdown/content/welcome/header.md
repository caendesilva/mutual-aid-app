# Welcome to The United States Mutual Aid App!

This mutual aid app is designed for people living in the United States to offer or access freely available resources. We want to enable people in need to easily find resources that they require to get them through difficult times. We also want to enable those willing to volunteer their time or resources to be able to offer them seamlessly and individually without being part of an organization.
