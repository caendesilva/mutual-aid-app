# About the Markdown Resources

To improve collaboration for techies and non techies alike, we store text for the website in the form of Markdown. Markdown is a type of text format that allows you to add styles to documents. Markdown files end in .md. You can learn about the syntax here https://www.markdownguide.org

Anyone can contribute to update the text and add more information. You can also suggest new pages and sections to add text for.
