## About this Document

<p class="lead">
	This document describes how we collect, use, and share information from and about our users, as well the choices you have and what measures we take to protect your data.

## About your privacy
**We take privacy seriously and as a rule, never store any more information than we need to.**

All you need to sign up is a name and email. If you are privacy-conscious you can use pseudonyms and an alternate email (as long as it can receive mail to verify your account). All other profile information is optional and only serves to improve your experience with the app. For example, if you add your zipcode or location we can show you listings that are close to you.

**We never sell or share any of your data.** Only a limited number of trusted staff have access to account information, and there are some things (like your password) that none of us can see.

## Data storage
We store user data in a secure managed database that is backed up daily. In the event of a failover, data handling is automatically switched over to standby nodes to minimize downtime. Database access is restricted to the server's private network. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

You can request a copy of your data at any time, within reason. You can also delete your account at any time if you would like to remove all of your data. _Note that we may be required to keep some limited data for legal reasons._

## Cookies
We use "Cookies" (small text files stored in your browser) to provide a better user experience for you.
We do not use cookies to track you or sell data or serve ads. Examples of how we use Cookies include keeping you logged in (if you check "remember me"), and remembering your user preferences. You can opt out of cookies by disabling them in your browser.
