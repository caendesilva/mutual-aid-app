# Privacy Policy

We take privacy seriously and as a rule, never store any more information than we need to.

All you need to sign up is a name and email. If you are privacy-conscious you can use pseudonyms and an alternate email (as long as it can receive mail to verify your account). All other profile information is optional and only serves to improve your experience with the app. For example, if you add your zipcode or location we can show you listings that are close to you.

We never sell or share any of your data. Only a limited number of trusted staff have access to account information, and there are some things (like your password) that none of us can see.

## Cookies
We use "Cookies" (small text files stored in your browser) to provide a better user experience for you.
We do not use cookies to track you or sell data or serve ads. Examples of how we use Cookies include keeping you logged in (if you check "remember me"), and remembering your user preferences. You can opt-out of cookies by disabling them in your browser.
