# Frequently asked Questions

## How does someone sign-up to receive these free resources?

You [register as a person in need](https://aidus.us/register?roles=pin) and enter your location (zip code or full address). A map will come up showing all the resources in your area. You can also filter these results by individual resource category. Each mutual aid provider listed can be directly contacted through the app or have their own contact information listed.

> Note: Some mutual aid providers may require you to verify who you are.

## Why do I have to verify who I am to receive free resources?

We only use email or phone number for verification and do not require you to submit your personal information such as name or full address to register on the app. Individuals that offer resources may not feel comfortable meeting strangers without communicating first. We have no control over what qualifications mutual aid providers may require before they assist others.

## What items or services are you able to offer through the app?

Food, water, shelter, financial services, legal services, etc. Anything legal being offered free of charge.

## Does the app/service cost money to use?

No. But we may need to ask for donations if it becomes popular to keep it operational.

## I found a bug!

As the Mutual Aid App is still in Public Beta there may be bugs. 

The source code for the app is hosted on GitHub where there is a tab called “Issues”. Please create a ticket there describing the bug. Creating an account is easy and free.
