    | Frontend Language Lines

    |
    | The values here are used to inject text displayed to the user.
    |
    | The values are specified in this file which is a PHP array.
    | A Language Line follows the following format:
    |	'key.name' => 'The translated value',
    | In the frontend, the key is then referenced using
	|	{{ __(file-name.key.name) }}
	| which then gets replaced with the translated value.
    |
    | I reccomended you use a smart text editor like VSCode (free)
    | to verify the syntax is correct. (i.e. you haven't forgotten
	| a comma somewhere, because that will make PHP sad.)
