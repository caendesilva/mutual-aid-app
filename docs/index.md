### Policy Documents
As the steering group is currently drafting policy documents, I'm working on the frontend.
I compiled the progress to static pages that can be accessed using the following links:
- https://static-staging.aidus.us/policy-drafts/community-guidelines.html
- https://static-staging.aidus.us/policy-drafts/terms-of-service.html
- https://static-staging.aidus.us/policy-drafts/privacy-policy

Signed, CDS.
